# About

`cast` is inspired by another open source project, [`spf13/cast`](https://github.com/spf13/cast), originally forked and extended to cover some specific use cases working with oddly encoded data. In this form, `cast` is intended to provide a simple generic API for converting data types to ease the consumption of unstructured data.
